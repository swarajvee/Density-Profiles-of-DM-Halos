# Density Profilles of Dark Matter Halos

- 1 First step was to plot the **Halo Mass Function** of the c000 (planck 18) abacus data. for this i have tried several packages in python. but only **HMF** package worked for me. 
so all the ode for finding the hmf function can be seen inside the HMF folder and the latest code will be the code with latest number (since each number epresents imporvement in the code)
